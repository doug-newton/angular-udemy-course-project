Lifecycle Hooks

ngOnChanges - called after a bound input property changes
ngOnInit - called once the component is initialised, before being displayed/added to the DOM. runs after the constructor
ngDoCheck - called every change detection cycle run: when angular checks, not only when something does actually need to change
ngAfterContentInit - called after content (ng-content) has been projected into the view
ngAfterContentChecked - called after ng-content has been checked
ngAfterViewInit - called after the component's view (and child views) has been initialised
ngAfterViewChecked - called after the view and child views have been checked
ngOnDestroy - called once the component is about to be destroyed / removed from the DOM

lifecycle hooks will be called appropriately regardless of whether
the component implements the corresponding interface
